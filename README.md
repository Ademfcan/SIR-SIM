# Population Simulation Experiment

This repository tests how simulating an [SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) for an epidemic compares to the same models as a simple differential equation. The idea came from a class project in my differential equations class. 

## Requirements
This was created using python 3.13.1, but will likely work on older (3.9+) versions 

Ensure dependencies are installed using:

```pip install -r requirements.txt````

## Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, run the following file:

```python Simulation.py```
