# Population Simulation Experiment

This repository tests how simulating an SIR model for an epidemic compares to the same models differential equation.

## Requirements
This was created using python 3.13.1, but will likely work on older (3.9+) versions 

Ensure dependencies are installed using:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, run the following file:

```python Simulation.py```
