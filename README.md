# Population Simulation Experiment

This repository tests how simulating a competing population compares to differential equation models.

## Requirements
This was created using python 3.13.1, but will likely work on older (3.9+) versions 

Ensure dependencies are installed using:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, run the following file:

```python display.py```
